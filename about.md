I am an engineer specialized in *Data Science* with a strong programming and mathematical background. I also have *DevOps* capabilities since I had the opportunity to deploy my solutions through *AWS* or *GCP*, I'm used to work with *docker*. I'm also interested in distributed infrastructures, as they are widely used in my domain (*Hadoop*, *Sparks*).
