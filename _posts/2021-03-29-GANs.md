Curious about GAN framework, I wanted to deal with it in depth. I completed the online course ([available on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans)), and then I decided to implement most of framework versions (vanilla DCGAN, WGAN, Conditional GAN etc...)

GANs are powerful architecture that can learn to generate data with same statistics of a given set. They have many applications: generate unreal human faces based on true ones, up-scale image or video resolution, create DNA sequences with certain properties,  etc... 

The main idea behind GAN is to use a *Generator* that creates fake examples and a *Discriminator* that tries to find these fake examples among the reals. Through an iterative process, it's likely that the generator creates more accurate example, and the discriminator classifies better fake and reals examples. Both the *Discriminator* and the *Generator* are neural networks. This duel between our 2 networks involves a *Game Theory* component, that we'll discuss later on. 



We will start with a very basic example, using a simple GAN architecture and dataset.

### Vanilla GAN

Let's start with the dataset, I generate a sample from a Gaussian Multivariate distribution with random mean and covariance. For visualization purpose, I make this example with both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional data.

*Real examples (2-dimensional)*

About the architecture, we've got 2 fully connected neural networks with 2 hidden layers. 

**Generator**

The generator takes a random vector as input of size *z* and outputs a vector having the same size as $$x_i$$. 

**Discriminator**

The generator takes a
