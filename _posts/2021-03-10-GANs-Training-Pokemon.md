The Pokemon sprites dataset has advantages, uniform low resolution images with a wide diversity.  Let's see how our WGAN with GP works on this task. The goal is not to create the next Pokemon generation but to observe and compare GANs performance through modification in its architecture, training components etc.. 



### 1) Test with Whole dataset (WGANs)

### 2) Test with a n-Pokemon dataset (WGANs)

![gans-pokemon-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gans/gans-pokemon-2.png)

### 3)  Test with pre-trained architecture



### 4) Auxiliary GANs
